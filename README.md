Main Theme: A platformer with a ball.

Design:
The player controlls a ball, and has to collect other parts of the ball to complete each level.

Ideas:
- You can throw a web like Spider Man, to stick to the walls. There is a limit for the length. The bigger the ball gets, the longer it gets.

- Puzzle Elements: Include puzzles or challenges that require the player to strategically use the ball's size or abilities to progress. This could involve maneuvering through tight spaces or using the ball's weight to trigger switches.

- Customization: Allow players to customize their ball with different colors, patterns, or accessories earned through completing levels or achieving milestones.

- Level editor mode.

- Each player action (moving and other stuff) will reduce the ball size(hp), so the player should choose the optimal path
